You can group together rows and split a table into a header, footer, and body by organising rows into thead, tfoot, and tbody elements.

Grouping rows can also provide a handy way to apply different styles to different parts of a table (as you will learn later). For example, if you wanted to change the background colour of a block of rows in a table, or have a different colour for the first row only.

<table summary="Interest Rates">
  <caption>Interest Rates</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Account Type</th>
      <th>Interest Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Smart</td>
      <td>From 2%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Young Saver</td>
      <td>From 1.6%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  
    <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Recommended for you: 'Young Saver'</td>
      <td>Interest from: 1.6%</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
