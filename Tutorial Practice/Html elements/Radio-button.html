//The key difference between this and the checkbox example is that, 
in this case, we have three different options,
 yet the name attribute is the same for all three inputs. 
 This is essential: it’s this value that binds the three inputs together. 
 They share the same name, but each has a different value attribute. 
 As a user selects an option and submits the form, the appropriate value is sent to the server. 
 Note also that each input has a different id. 
 In fact, any id that is assigned to an element in the document must be unique. 
 It also benefits the label elements, which must refer to unique identifiers.
