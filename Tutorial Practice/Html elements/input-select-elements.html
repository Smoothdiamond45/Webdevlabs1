<div class="form-row">
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name = "name">
</div>

//The select element is used to create a drop-down list. 
//The options within the drop-down list are defined using the option element.


The elements will be styled to become flex containers and the flex-direction will default to row. 
This will ensure that the label and form element are on the same row. 
The div (with class = .form-row) is styled as follows:

.form-row {
   	display: flex;
}

//The label (flex item) will be assigned a width of 20%. 
The element label is styled as follows:
.form-row > label {
    flex: 0 1 20%;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1.2em;
}



n the row, the form element (text box or select menu) is also a flex item and it will grow to take up the remaining space on the row. 
If we do not allow the form element to grow, the the form element from row to row will vary in size. 
So, to ensure on each row that the form elements have the same size, allow them to grow. 
The form element is styled as follows:


form input, form select {
    flex: 1; 
    padding: .5em;
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}
