<textarea name="comments" id= "comments">
This is a text area with default rows of 2 and default columns of 20.
</textarea>

//The textarea element is used to create a multi-line text input field. 
//By default, the textarea element displays with 2 rows and 20 columns,
// but these values can be changed using the rows and cols attributes.



<textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows = "5" cols="40" >
This is a text area with 5 rows and 40
columns visible by default. The text
inside the element is its default value.
Although the control is limited in size,
the text entered can be larger than this
size, and the user agent will presumably
offer a scrolling mechanism for it.
</textarea>

//In this example, the textarea element is set to display with 5 rows and 40 columns. 
//The text between the opening and closing textarea tags
// is the default value that appears in the text area when the page is loaded.  
//Note that any whitespace (spaces, tabs, or line breaks)
// within the textarea element is preserved
