//The form above contains two radio buttons that allow the user to choose between subscribing and unsubscribing from a mailing list.
When the form is submitted, the value of the selected radio button is sent to the server along with the e-mail address.
The name attribute for both radio buttons is the same (action),
    which groups them together.
This ensures that only one of the options can be selected at any one time.
The value attribute for each radio button is different (subscribe and unsubscribe),
    which is the value that is sent to the server when the form is submitted.

//The reset button in the form above will clear all user input and return the form to its initial state. 
In addition, the onreset event handler is used to set the focus to the name text box
 so that the user can begin entering their details again immediately.
