      <h2>After Leaving Cert</h2>
      <img src="images/volleyballteam.jpg"> 
      <p>(yes this is a very recent photo of the SETU volleyball team playing in limerick, i have maybe 8 photos of myself)</p>
      
      <p>After completing my Leaving Cert, I enrolled in MTU in Mechanical Engineering but left after the first semester</p>
      <p>A few years later i decided to do a Level 5 Software development course in FET Douglas Street Campus</p>
      <p>During this course i learned the basics of coding and got a better understanding of how the software side of computers work</p>
      <p>Since i already knew how the hardware worked</p>

      <p>After completing that i did the Level 6 version in Morrisons Island Campus</p>

      <blockquote>I learned some of the basics to Python, SQL Databases, Java and JavaFX, C++, Web dev (HTML & Wordpress)</blockquote>
      
      <h2>Best Part</h2>
      <p>The whole reason I did the Level 5 was i thought it would help me get better at diagnosing OS issues</p>
      <p>(at the time i was working as a repair technician)</p>
      <p>I had no idea how coding worked or even what it was</p>
      <p>By the end of the Level 6 i had a basic understanding of how coding works and could write simple programs in multiple languages although</p>
      <p>i didnt and still dont enjoy the OOP version of C++</p>
