      <p>After completing my Leaving Cert, I enrolled in MTU in Mechanical Engineering but left after the first semester</p>
      <p>A few years later i decided to do a Level 5 Software development course in FET Douglas Street Campus</p>

      <p>After completing that i did the Level 6 version in Morrisons Island Campus</p>
      <img src="images/morrisonsislandcampus.jpg">
      <p>I learned some of the basics to Python, SQL Databases, Java and JavaFX, C++, Web dev (HTML & Wordpress)</p>
      <h2>Best Part</h2>
      <p>The whole reason I did the Level 5 was i thought it would help me get better at diagnosing OS issues</p>
      <p>(at the time i was working as a repair technician)</p>
      <p>I had no idea how coding worked or even what it was</p>
